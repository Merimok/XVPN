# 🔧 HOTFIX v1.2.7 - CI/CD Debugging Enhancement

**Date:** June 10, 2025  
**Type:** Critical CI/CD Fix  
**Version:** v1.2.7  
**Status:** ✅ Deployed for Testing

---

## 🐛 **Issue Resolved**

### **Problem:**
```
Run copy sing-box\sing-box.exe build\windows\runner\Release\sing-box.exe
The system cannot find the path specified.
0 file(s) copied.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

### **Root Cause:**
- Files were being copied before successful download verification
- No existence checks before copy operations
- Insufficient debugging information for troubleshooting
- Silent failures in dependency download process

---

## ✅ **Implemented Fixes**

### 1. **File Existence Verification**
```yaml
if exist sing-box\sing-box.exe (
  echo "Found sing-box.exe, copying..."
  copy sing-box\sing-box.exe build\windows\runner\Release\sing-box.exe
) else (
  echo "ERROR: sing-box.exe not found in sing-box folder"
  dir sing-box
  exit 1
)
```

### 2. **Enhanced Download Logging**
```yaml
echo "Downloading sing-box from: $URL"
curl -L "$URL" -o "vpn_client/sing-box/sing-box.exe"
echo "Download completed. File size:"
ls -la vpn_client/sing-box/sing-box.exe
```

### 3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Added directory listing on file not found
- Detailed step-by-step logging
- Graceful failure with informative messages
- Size verification after downloads

### 4. **Process Verification**
- Check each download step completion
- Verify file existence before operations
- Ensure proper directory structure
- Validate file integrity with size checks

---

## 🔍 **Updated Workflows**

### **build_windows.yml Changes:**
- ✅ Enhanced sing-box download logging
- ✅ Added Wintun download verification
- ✅ File existence checks before copying
- ✅ Detailed error messages and directory listings

### **release.yml Changes:**
- ✅ Same enhancements as build_windows.yml
- ✅ Comprehensive debugging output
- ✅ Improved error handling for releases
- ✅ Step-by-step process verification

---

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **This Release Will Show:**
1. **Download Success**: Whether dependencies download correctly
2. **File Detection**: If existence checks work properly
3. **Copy Operations**: Whether file copying succeeds
4. **Error Reporting**: Quality of debugging information

### **Expected Outcomes:**
- ✅ **Success**: Clean build with proper file handling
- ⚠️ **Partial**: Better error messages if issues persist
- ❌ **Failure**: Clear diagnosis of remaining problems
